# EduSummarizer Hub Freemium Improvements TODO

This TODO outlines prioritized improvements to transform the project into a scalable freemium platform. Tasks are grouped by phase for logical implementation order.

## Phase 1: Core Freemium Foundation (Auth + Tiers)
- [ ] Implement user authentication (email/password + OAuth with Google/GitHub)
- [ ] Set up database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for user data and usage tracking
- [ ] Add JWT-based session management and password hashing
- [ ] Create freemium tiers: Free (10 summaries/month, 3 languages) vs Premium ($9.99/month, unlimited)
- [ ] Integrate Stripe for premium subscriptions
- [ ] Add usage limits and upgrade prompts in UI
- [ ] Update backend to enforce limits per user

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features & Scalability
- [ ] Upgrade AI models (integrate OpenAI/Anthropic with fallbacks)
- [ ] Add Redis caching for repeated AI requests
- [ ] Deploy backend on scalable cloud (AWS Lambda/Railway) with load balancing
- [ ] Implement PWA features: service workers, offline caching, app manifest
- [ ] Add push notifications for quiz reminders (premium feature)
- [ ] Refactor frontend to React/Vue for dynamic components
- [ ] Implement dark mode and drag-and-drop uploads
- [ ] Add real-time progress bars and accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers)

## Phase 3: Analytics, Security & Polish
- [ ] Integrate Google Analytics/Mixpanel for user tracking and A/B testing

- [ ] Add API versioning (/v1/*) and comprehensive error handling/logging (Sentry)
- [ ] Optimize landing page for SEO, add testimonials and in-app tutorials
- [ ] Implement referral program for user growth

## General Tasks
- [ ] Set up Docker for consistent deployment
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for backend APIs
- [ ] Update documentation for new features
- [ ] Monitor performance and iterate based on analytics data

## Notes
- Prioritize Phase 1 for monetization foundation.
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next.
- Budget for API costs (AI, analytics) in freemium model.
- Track progress by checking off completed items.
